<p>Survivalist was a local band from Racine, WI including myself and some friends that were into the local metal music scene. This small project was developed to market the band locally as well as serve as a one stop shop for all merchandise, music, and social media. The site is developed through Wordpress with a customized theme and is fully responsive and mobile friendly.</p>
